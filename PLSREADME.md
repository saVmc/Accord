  Hi MR Clark!!
  PLEASE NOTE!!!!: I was reading through the assesment notification, and I read over citing my use of online
  resources. So to align with it, I've written this to disclose my utilization of such assets which were crucial
  to the development of my own knowledge and my app, such as guides, ai, etc :) Sorry for making you read such a big block 

  During the course of this Assesment task, while I have prioritized learning
  all that I can and coding everything myself, I have had to inevitably turn to the help of online
  reasources such as tutorials, free libraries, and AI. Specifically, the main usage of these resources
  has been to help me understand significantly more complex components that I had to implement in order
  to achieve my full listed requirements I set for this project. While https://www.w3schools.com/ has 
  been a very valuable resource in teaching me the fundamentals/semi-advanced concepts needed, there 
  were many times I had to turn to AI for help as some of my ideas were way beyond my skillset at the time
  (and I determined to get them into my project). What I did learn from these resources, however, 
  I made sure to pass on to my peers as well, aiding others in our class Discord server and helping 
  them with their issues in class as well :]

  For the advanced polished formatting of my website, I have also utilized some more advanced 
  elements from online pen libraries or forums, such as https://reactbits.dev/, https://codepen.io, 
  https://jsfiddle.net/, and https://getbootstrap.com/. 
  
  If written for a different project types, such as React, I used VSC Copilot and other AI models to convert
  the code to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS that would work for my project. Furthermore, while each individual feature of 
  my site I've made sure to understand, I have used AI to improve my grammar and syntax as a whole (in monsterously
  long files), along with fixes that I really couldn't understand. It has helped me maintain the constant mess
  of my project as I've put in lots of hours into trying to make an app that I feel satisfied with.

  That being said, I have actively made a concious effort to learn and understand the code I've implemented.
  I've had a lot of fun researching and testing and experiment with all my insane ideas and I feel I've 
  learned a lot from this task, coding, problem solving and project management in general.
  I hope you enjoy my project as much as I enjoyed making it! Thanks for reading this far :)
