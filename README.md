## Part 1 – Project Definition and Requirements

### Project Overview

Accord is a cross-platform social networking and productivity app designed specifically for students, schools, and educational institutions. It is inspired by the best of both Google Classroom and Discord, merging instant messaging, assignment submission, and time management into one single, mega-intuitive interface.

Accord helps students communicate, collaborate, and stay organized—all within a secure and moderated environment tailored to meet the needs of education in 2025. Through its real-time messaging system, students can easily engage in class discussions, form study groups and calls, and share ideas freely, while teachers are still in control over message visibility and moderation.
