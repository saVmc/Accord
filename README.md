## Part 1 ‚Äì Project Definition and Requirements

### Project Overview

Accord is a cross-platform social networking and productivity app designed specifically for students, schools, and educational institutions. It is inspired by the best of both Google Classroom and Discord, merging instant messaging, assignment submission, and time management into one single, mega-intuitive interface.

Accord helps students communicate, collaborate, and stay organized‚Äîall within a secure and moderated environment tailored to meet the needs of education in 2025. Through its real-time messaging system, students can easily engage in class discussions, form study groups and calls, and share ideas freely, while teachers are still in control over message visibility and moderation.

### Visual Design Choices
| Element        | Choice                                | Reason |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|--------|
| Primary Colour | Navy (#0A1F44)                        | Professional, doesn't hurt to look at |
| Secondary      | White (#FFFFFF)                 | Looks great against navy |
| Accent         | Green (#1DB954)                        | helps to draw attention to active items |

## Part 4 - Designing algorithms

### Feature im trying to figure out
**Login & Role-Based Access!** (Student/Teacher)

---

### Simple Algorithm for this 
1. User opens login screen  
2. Enter email + password  
3. Check email format  
   - Invalid ‚Üí error message ‚Üí stop  
4. Search database for email  
   - Not found ‚Üí error message ‚Üí stop  
5. Compare entered password (encrypted) with stored encrypted password  
   - No match ‚Üí error message ‚Üí stop  
6. If match ‚Üí start session and check role:  
   - Teacher ‚Üí Teacher Home/Dashboard  
   - Student ‚Üí Student Home
  


  **Flow Chart:**  
  ![Login Flowchart](media/login_flowchart.png)


**Complexity:**  
Might be fast enough for like a couple users? the system stops early on invalid details and only checks one account at a time though, not very efficient or 

### Test Cases :D
based off of my test feature
